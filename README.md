About shows your version and whether it is the Fatum Version or the Nexus Version

### Install

Download the installer (Fatum Version) from the [installer release](https://github.com/ifatum/DyingLightFaTrainer/releases/tag/installer):

- **Windows**: `FaTrainer-Fatum-Version-Installer.exe`
- **Linux**: `FaTrainer-Fatum-Version-Installer-Linux.tar.gz`, unpack it and run `FaTrainer-Fatum-Version-Installer` (works on any distribution with glibc 2.27 or newer and `curl` or `wget`). On NixOS start it with `steam-run ./FaTrainer-Fatum-Version-Installer`

On Linux, Dying Light has to run through Proton (Properties → Compatibility → force a Proton version); the trainer does not load in the native Linux version.

The installer finds Dying Light in your Steam libraries (or lets you choose the folder), downloads `xinput1_3.dll` from the release, checks it against the release checksum and puts it next to `DyingLightGame.exe`. Run it again to update or uninstall. On Linux it also shows the Steam launch option Proton needs:

```
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="xinput1_3=n,b" %command%
```

The installer has its own version and updates itself: when a newer installer is out, its main button becomes Update the installer. When a newer trainer is released, the trainer stays off in game and asks you to run the installer again. The game itself keeps working, and without internet the trainer works as usual.

The **Nexus Version** on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglight/mods/1724) (`FaTrainer-Nexus-Version-Installer`) is offline: its installer has the trainer inside, and neither connects to the internet, so there is no update check. Nexus Mods tells you about updates when you track the mod.

Press **Insert** or **F8** in game to open the menu. While it is open the game ignores your mouse and keyboard. A dot in the sidebar marks pages with something turned on, and **Turn all off** resets every cheat and slider at once.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed in each version.

### Building

`./build.sh` builds the trainer, `./build_installer.sh` both installers (the Fatum Version in `dist/`, the offline Nexus Version in `dist/nexus/`, built with `-DFATRAINER_OFFLINE`) `./release.sh` the trainer release files and the Nexus Mods zip, and `./release_installer.sh` the installer release files (all through nix; `--publish` uploads them).

### Notes

- Made for single player. Back up your saves first.
- Log file: `fatrainer.log` next to `DyingLightGame.exe`.

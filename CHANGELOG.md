# Changelog

## 2.2 b1

- The FaTrainer Installer now has its own version (Installer 1.0) and keeps itself up to date.
- XP gain now multiplies experience in every skill tree, Survivor and Night Hunter included, and the game's XP popup shows the boosted amount. Before it only changed Agility, Power and Driver.
- Fixed: Unbreakable weapons did not protect weapons you picked up after turning it on, until you pressed Refresh.
- Skills page: each skill tree is a tile with its level, an XP bar you can drag to set the XP, -10, -1, +1 point, +10 and Max, and Skill points - and + that add points without changing the level.
- Health and stamina bars on the Player page can be dragged to set them.
- New: Take less damage, as a survivor and as the Night Hunter.
- New: Less UV damage for the Night Hunter.
- New: One hit kill on the Night Hunter, on the PvP page.
- New: Sure-hit ground pound for the Night Hunter. The game only counts a survivor as hit when its blast trace reaches his body, so a step or uneven ground could make the ground pound miss even right next to him. Both Night Hunter presets turn it on.
- Fixed: the Night Hunter presets made the tackle miss. They widen the pounce aim, which the game shares with the tackle, so the tackle locked onto survivors beside you while charging straight ahead. The tackle now always keeps its normal aim.
- Fixed: Spit hit radius made a Night Hunter's spits hit you from anywhere while you played a survivor. The game that hosts the match decides spit hits, so the slider now only works while you play the Night Hunter, and only when you host.
- Fixed: Claws made your melee miss survivors next to you. It widened the range the game uses to pick a melee target, so the swipe turned toward survivors far away. Claws now only lengthens the reach.
- The Ground pound slider also raises how far above or below you a survivor can still be hit (normally 2 m).
- Fixed: the Night Hunter rank showed a number like 44890 instead of its name. Ranks now show the title and change one title at a time. In a Be The Zombie match the side you are not playing is grayed out.
- Versions now have build numbers, like 2.2 b1. A newer build of your version downloads itself and starts the next time you open the game; until then the build you have keeps working. A newer version still needs the FaTrainer Installer, and an older version stays off unless you tick Use older versions.
- The installer lists each version once and always installs its newest build.
- New: the FaTrainer Installer lets you pick which version to install, and its Use older versions checkbox lets an older version keep working in game after a newer one is out. The update notice still shows; without the checkbox an older version stays turned off, as before.
- Presets are now Configs, on the PvP page and in Settings. Built-in configs can be deleted too, and Restore built-in configs brings them back: the four built-in ones plus your own. New config saves what is on now, and every config of yours can be loaded, saved over, renamed and deleted. Your old configs carry over.
- The Night Hunter page moved to Cheats, and the sidebar no longer shows a section twice after you reorder pages.

## 2.1

- New: Dodge spit on the PvP page, under As a survivor. When a spit is about to hit you, you step aside on your own: after a human reaction time, for a short random moment, sideways when it can, using W A S D. It only reacts to spit that would really hit you, never presses against a key you hold and never touches your mouse. Also part of both Survivor presets.
- New: Night Hunter glow color on the Visuals page. The veins that light up when UV hits the Night Hunter glow in your own color and brightness, like the UV light color.
- Fixed: the Skills page showed no skill trees and could not change them. The trainer looked for them in the wrong place.
- New: a redesigned menu that matches the installer and the website, with the same fonts, colors and Harran skyline. It fades and slides in when you open it, page titles write themselves in, cards appear one after another, the active page marker slides between pages, and buttons, switches, sliders and messages animate. The city at the bottom of the sidebar lights its windows and follows your mouse.
- New: more ways to make the menu yours in Settings, Appearance: accent color, window opacity, corner roundness, background dim, animations (Full, Subtle or Off), and the skyline and accent glow on or off.
- New: four ready-made Be The Zombie presets on the PvP page: Survivor Legit, Survivor Rage, Night Hunter Legit and Night Hunter Rage. Legit stays believable to the other players, Rage holds nothing back. Each one also sets the player ESP to match.
- New: the menu shows whether you have the Fatum Version or the Nexus Version, under the FaTrainer name and in Settings, About, together with what that version does.
- Fixed: most cheats could stop working for the rest of the session. Sometimes, during a loading screen, the game replaced its window handler and the trainer no longer got the signal it applies the cheats on. The trainer now notices this and takes the window back.

## 2.0

- New: FaTrainer Installer for Windows and Linux. It finds Dying Light in your Steam libraries (or lets you choose the folder) and puts the trainer next to the game. It also updates and uninstalls, shows this changelog and, on Linux, the Steam launch option with a copy button. The Fatum Version (from the website and GitHub) fetches the trainer from the GitHub release and checks it against the release checksum; the Nexus Version (from Nexus Mods) has the trainer inside and never connects to the internet.
- New, Fatum Version only: update check. When the game starts, the trainer asks GitHub for the newest version number. If a newer FaTrainer is out, this version stays turned off and shows a short notice; open the installer and press Update. The game itself keeps working. Without internet the trainer works as before. The Nexus Version has no update check; track the mod on Nexus Mods to hear about new versions.
- The trainer file now carries its version in its Windows file properties, so the installer and you can see which version is installed.

## 1.9

- New: configs on the Settings page. Save the cheats and sliders you have on under a name, then load or delete them with one click. Each config is a small file in fatrainer_configs next to the game.
- New: Death from above height on the PvP page. The game only starts Death From Above once you are already falling fast (12 m/s, a long drop). At Max a normal jump is enough.
- Fixed: PvP sliders, Slow down UV flashlight and other cheats stopping after you die. After a respawn the trainer now recognises your new character straight away and finds the game objects again on its own.
- New: Visuals page with a player ESP for Be The Zombie and co-op: box, role (Night Hunter or survivor), health bar and number, distance, PvP rank, hunter rage, lines from the screen bottom, allies on or off, a range limit and separate colors for the Night Hunter and survivors. It keeps drawing with the menu closed.
- New: custom UV light color and glow on the Visuals page.
- New: spit keys on the Night Hunter page. Pick your own key for the Horde Summoner, UV Suppressor, Sense Suppressor and Toxic spit; the trainer presses the game's key for it.
- Fixed: one hit kill no longer drops Be The Zombie nests to 1 health, so their health bar is not stuck on red.
- New: Spit hit radius slider on the PvP page (replaces the old Spit slider, which only changed one spit type). Horde Summoner, UV Suppressor and Sense Suppressor spits affect survivors further from where they land (5 m normally, up to 30 m), and Toxic spit puddles grow with it.
- No ability cooldowns no longer sets the grab break cooldown, which the game never reads.
- Fixed: crashes and stutter while the ESP or one hit kill was on. The trainer searched all game memory every 3 seconds, twice, and could crash when the game freed memory during the search. It now does one search, every 10 seconds for players, at low priority with short pauses, and skips memory that disappears mid-read instead of crashing. When game objects for a cheat are missing (for example in menus), it searches less and less often instead of every 15 seconds.
- Fixed: the ESP flickering or not showing in Be The Zombie. It now draws from the game camera and holds each player for a moment when the game skips a position update, instead of depending on finding your own character first.

## 1.8.1

- Fixed: the game could crash at start on Windows. The trainer's memory scan read game memory that the game was freeing at the same time; on Windows it now copies each block safely first.
- Fixed: a crash when the trainer read the position of a character that was being removed (Kill all enemies, saved positions, prison sections).
- Unbreakable weapons keeps each weapon's own durability full instead of relying on game settings, so it works for every melee weapon, including the Korek Machete.

## 1.8

- Fixed: zombies and NPCs standing still. Cheats that change game settings (for example the grappling hook) also changed a different setting of every zombie and NPC. They now only change your own settings.
- Fixed: giving an item could crash the game when the trainer tried it in the ammo inventory. Only ammo goes there now.
- Fixed a crash that could happen after turning a cheat off. The trainer wrote to game memory that the game had already freed, for example after a level load.
- Infinite UV flashlight: fixed. The trainer was filling the normal flashlight's battery instead of the UV charge.
- Instant lockpicking: fixed. The game now treats every pick position as the sweet spot, so the lock always turns all the way.
- Fixed a crash while loading into a save and when pressing Find sections: the trainer read prison section positions through the wrong part of the object. Positions are now looked up the way the game's own class layout describes, and only when you press Find sections.
- New: weapon rarity in the weapon editor (Gray, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange, Gold). Found and generated weapons keep their own rarity, so the editor changes that one weapon, and the game saves it with the weapon.
- New: Slow down UV flashlight slider next to Infinite UV flashlight. x10 makes the charge last ten times longer.
- New: Night Hunter level on the Skills page (-10, -1, +1, +10, Max), and a Be The Zombie ranks card to change your survivor and Night Hunter PvP rank.
- New: Kill all enemies nearby (Combat and Prison pages). Kills every zombie and human within 80 m through the game's own kill, so quest objectives like killing the bandits or a final wave count them.
- New: route recorder on the Prison page. Record your route once while playing normally; Replay teleports you along it in small steps so every quest trigger fires, and pauses where you stood still (fights, doors) until you press Continue. Saved in fatrainer_route.txt next to the game.
- Prison sections are recognised again (they all showed as unnamed sections before) and listed in run order: Start, every split checkpoint (Split 1, 2, ...), the reward room and the evacuation. A Next section button jumps to them one after another.
- Teleporting moves your physics body too, so the game no longer pulls you back to where you stood.
- God mode also works in Harran Prison: while it is on, the game's forced damage (which the prison uses) is blocked too.
- Infinite grappling hook keeps the rope energy full directly, so the hook is ready every time, also while you are still hanging on the rope.
- Pause prison timers: the trainer now takes ownership of the prison timer data like the game does, so the paused time is no longer overwritten.
- Cheats that need game objects (UV flashlight, grappling hook, prison timers) find them again on their own after a level load, even when the menu stays closed.
- Turning a cheat off restores a value only if the game has not changed it since.
- Ignores stray stash objects with garbage capacity.

## 1.7

- New: Prison page for Harran Prison. Pause the run timer and the reward room countdown, teleport to every prison section, and save and load your position anywhere.
- Infinite grappling hook: the hook's wait comes from rope energy, not from a cooldown, so the rope now recharges instantly.
- Infinite UV flashlight: the UV charge is held full directly on your equipment.
- Refill health and stamina writes full health and stamina itself if the game's refill leaves them low.
- Instant lockpicking also searches the game's own data for the lock difficulty settings.
- Fixed: giving items could crash the game when the item used as a template had just been removed. The trainer now takes it from your live inventory and checks it first.
- Fixed: the stash shows on the Stash page again (its capacity is unlimited, not -1).
- Fixed: memory scans under Proton skip Wine's own thread memory, which showed extra wallets and players.
- New pages are placed next to their group in the sidebar when you update.

## 1.6

- Infinite grappling hook and infinite UV flashlight: the trainer now hooks the function the game uses to read these settings, so the new values reach every place that uses them.
- New: instant lockpicking. Every pick position opens the lock and lockpicks never break.
- New: Level up button on the Skills page. It gives exactly the XP for the next level, so the game levels you up like normal play.
- Giving items tries every inventory until the game accepts the item, so upgrades like King and Clicker work, and ammo goes into the ammo inventory.
- Typing in the menu works under Proton: money amounts, search boxes, item counts and weapon stats.
- PvP: one slider per attack instead of separate range and angle sliders. At Max the pounce and dropkick also hit targets that are not in front of you.
- PvP: death from above has two sliders, range and pull. At Max pull the hunter can be beside or behind you and the attack pulls you onto him.
- Cash is one simple option: one amount, quick buttons and Set.
- The stash shows up even when it is empty, and only one stash is listed.
- Interface size changes only when you press Apply, so the slider no longer jumps while you drag it.
- Clearer labels on the Give items, inventory and PvP pages.
- Fixed: the memory scan could pick up stale copies from its own thread stack under Proton, which showed extra wallets.
- Better logs for bug reports: system, overlays and other mods, every overlay start step, a first frame watchdog, your inventories, failed gives and messages.

## 1.5

- New sidebar menu grouped into Cheats, Be The Zombie and Items. A dot marks pages with something turned on, and Turn all off resets everything.
- Settings saved to fatrainer.ini: accent color, interface size, background dim, menu key, page order and visibility, remembered cheats.
- The game ignores your mouse and keyboard while the menu is open, the background dims, and the mouse wheel scrolls the menu.
- Player: god mode, infinite stamina, infinite grappling hook, infinite UV flashlight, no fall damage, movement speed, jump height, refill health and stamina.
- Combat: one hit kill, infinite ammo, no reload, infinite consumables, unbreakable weapons.
- Skills: XP gain multiplier and skill tree levels with -10, -1, +1, +10 and Max.
- Night Hunter: hunter god mode, infinite energy, no ability cooldowns, infinite spits, long camouflage.
- PvP: range and aim angle sliders for pounce, ground pound, tackle, claws, spit, death from above, dropkick, kicks and melee.
- Weapon editor: magazine size and reload time, and edits stay applied while the game runs.
- Your own character is found correctly in co-op.

## 1.0.0

- First release: cash, backpack, stash, materials, give any item or blueprint, weapon editor.
- Works on Windows and on Linux with Proton.
